# pandas-challenge2
Hi there,
  I had a very hard week with this week's HW and didnt finish completely. I know I am missing something and need to work with my tutor.
  I also created an original pandas-challenge repository for a V1 of my group project, but couldnt figure out how to delete the files and made this instead.
  I tried getting during help OH to little avail and had to cancel my tutoring session this week to finish the group project. 
  I understand that will effect my grade.
  Thanks,
   Valerie
